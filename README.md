# MediaMover
Move files up one folder, allowing for easier organization in libraries.

I use this script to help gather media together, taking each show out of its own separate folder.

Add whichever extensions you want to move into the txt folder and run the script.

Works well in conjunction with [this script](https://github.com/GHershkowitz/createSeasonFolder) to create Season folders, requires particular name formatting for shows, I use [TheRenamer](http://www.therenamer.com/) for that.
